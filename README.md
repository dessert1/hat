### HAT (Hyper-AT) is an one time run job scheduler for GNU/Linux, with an emphasis on usability. It is designed to be a direct replacement of `at` (`atq`, `atrm`), `batch`, and other such one time run task scheduling engines/toolsets.

Benefits of `hat`:

- Seconds resolution i.e. you can run job at the mentioned second
- Use your shell of choice; you're not bound to `/bin/sh`
- All-in-one i.e. no separate tool based on job or pattern
- Extended features
- Easy to use
